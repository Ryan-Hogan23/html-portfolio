<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Ryan, I have decided on a career change and thought that Web Development would be a very cool area to be in.</p>

<p>I have been studying Web Development for about 4 months now and I am really enjoying the process. Originally I was using different sources, I was using FreeCodeCamp and also TOP. Which both are good but I have decided to try the Angela Yu course now as it comes highly recommended.</p>

<p>These have been two very simple projects for my website so far but I do hope in the future they will be a little more advanced and that people will actually be impressed at what they find here...</p>
